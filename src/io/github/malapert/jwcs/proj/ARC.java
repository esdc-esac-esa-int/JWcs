 * Zenithal equidistant.

 * The zenithal equidistant projection Ô¨Årst appeared in Greisen (1983) as ARC.
 * It is widely used as the approximate projection of Schmidt telescopes.
 * The native meridians are uniformly divided to give equispaced parallels.
 *  This projection was also known in antiquity.
